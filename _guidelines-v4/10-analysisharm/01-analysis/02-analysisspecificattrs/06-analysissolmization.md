Solmization is a system which associates a syllable with each note of a musical scale. There are various forms of solmization used throughout the world. In Europe and North America, solfège is the most common practice. In this system, the seven syllables for a major scale are do, ré, mi, fa, sol, la and si. In the ‘fixed-do’ system, the syllable "do" is always associated with the pitch "c", while in the ‘movable-do’ system, "do" is associated with the tonic note. The **@psolfa** attribute is only allowed on {% include link elem="note" %} and {% include link elem="nc" %} elements. Its value is unconstrained in order to accommodate various solmization systems.
